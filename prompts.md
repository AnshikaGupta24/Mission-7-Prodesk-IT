1) The Mission: "The Registration Wizard"
Theme: Controlled Components, State Management, Regex, and Form Validation.
Goal: Build a multi-step onboarding form (like setting up a new bank account or SaaS profile).
Why this project?
Nobody likes filling out a 20-question form on one page. Modern apps break forms down into bite-sized "Steps" or "Wizards." This requires clever state management so you don't lose the user's data when they click "Next" or "Back".
provide me a step by step explanation of this task in simple wy possible.

2) The UI: Build a form that is broken into 3 separate views/components:
Step 1: Personal Info (First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth).
Step 2: Account Details (Email, Password, Confirm Password).
Step 3: Review & Submit (Display all entered data so the user can check it).
The Navigation: Add "Next" and "Back" buttons to move between steps.
The State: Use React State (useState) in a Parent component to hold the data from all 3 steps. If I type my name in Step 1, go to Step 2, and click "Back", my name should still be there!
Submission: On Step 3, clicking "Submit" should console.log() the final data object and show a "Success!" screen.
